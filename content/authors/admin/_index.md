I can sum myself up in two words: **Data Nerd**. From a young age I was drawn to mathematics and problem solving. I have always been interested in finding multiple ways to come up with a solution and then picking it apart to understand *why* it works that way. Fast forward to today and that means I love taking huge data sets and exploring their trends and outliers. The contexts for this type of exploration are endless! Population migration, industry clusters throughout the US, which college programs to offer, or even how the rural divide impacts student achievement. Learning how these things affect the world around us both positively and negatively can help determine the necessary steps to make improvements.
